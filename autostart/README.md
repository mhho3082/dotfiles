# `autostart/`

The scripts that would be run upon system startup would be here.
Included things are, e.g., monitor switching.

Remember to auto-start the scripts with your desktop environment;
e.g., for XFCE: set to "launch on login" in sessions and startup
(The provided i3 config does that for you).
